The Object3D class is the core building block in Three.js, serving as the base for almost every
3D object, including meshes, cameras, lights, and groups. In your Nim + SDL3 GPU API version,
we'll replicate its functionality while optimizing for Nim's performance and language features.

Some Key Responsibilities of Object3D

Transformations:

Position (Vector3), rotation (Quaternion or Euler angles), and scale (Vector3).
Transformation matrices (matrix, matrixWorld).
Methods for updating these transformations.

Hierarchy Management:
Parent-child relationships.
Scene graph traversal methods (add(), remove(), traverse()).

Visibility and Rendering Flags:
visible, castShadow, receiveShadow, etc.
